* Service
** Service without a selector
- you can reference external services using a service without a selector
- selector just creates a *Kubernetes Endpoint* object that points to another k8s resource

- when creating a service without a selector, k8s endpoint must be created explicitly
  - these two are linked using ~medatada.name~ field
