#+title: Kubernetes Service

* Service without a selector
- link: [[]]
- you can reference external services using a service without a selector
- selector just creates a *Kubernetes Endpoint* object that points to another k8s resource

- when creating a service without a selector, k8s endpoint must be created explicitly
  - these two are linked using ~medatada.name~ field

** Example
#+begin_src yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9200
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  name: my-service
subsets:
  - addresses:
      - ip: 192.0.2.42
    ports:
      - port: 9200
